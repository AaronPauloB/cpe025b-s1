    <h1>How to make Poached Eggs</h1>
    
    <h2>Poached Egg Quick and Easy</h2>

    <img src="module1\egg.jpg" alt="egg">
    
    <p>A delicate, shell-less egg cooked gently in simmering liquid (usually water with vinegar) until the white is tender and set, while the yolk remains warm and runny, creating a creamy, sauce-like center, often with a plump, oval shape ideal for breakfast dishes like Eggs Benedict</p>
    
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 1 to 4</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> enough to fill a pot about 3 to 4 inches deep</li>
        <li><strong>White Vinegar:</strong> 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>Prepare the water:</strong> Fill a medium to large saucepan with about 3 to 4 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. You want small bubbles rising from the bottom, but the surface should not be rapidly boiling or aggressively bubbling.</em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Add vinegar (optional):</strong>Stir in the white vinegar to help the egg whites set faster and stay together.</em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Prepare the egg:</strong> Crack a cold egg into a small bowl or ramekin. This allows for a controlled, gentle slide into the water and ensures the yolk is intact. For an extra neat, spherical egg, you can first strain the raw egg through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the thin, wispy egg whites that tend to disperse in the water.</em></li>
        <li><em><strong>Poach the egg:</strong></em></li>    
            <ol>
                <li><em><strong>Classic Method:</strong> Gently stir the simmering water with a spoon to create a slow-moving whirlpool or vortex. Carefully and quickly slip the egg into the center of the vortex. The spinning motion helps wrap the white around the yolk.</em></li>
                <li><em><strong>No-Swirl Method:</strong> Simply place the bowl close to the surface of the water and gently slip the egg into the simmering water. This method can be easier for cooking multiple eggs at once.</em></li>
            </ol>
        <li><em>Season with fish sauce, lime juice, and chili paste.</em></li>
        <li><em>Garnish with Thai basil and serve hot.</em></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Cooking Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh eggs are key:</strong> Use the freshest eggs you can find, as they have firmer whites that hold their shape better during poaching.</li>
        <li><strong>Water temperature matters:</strong> Avoid a rapid, rolling boil, which can break up the delicate egg. A gentle simmer is ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't add salt to the water:</strong> Salt can cause the egg whites to break apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Make ahead:</strong> Poached eggs can be made ahead of time and stored in cold water in the refrigerator for a couple of days. To reheat, place them in a bowl of hot tap water for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
