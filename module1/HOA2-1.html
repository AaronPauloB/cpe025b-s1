<h1>Daang Bakal University</h1>
<p>Welcome to Daang Bakal University, where learning happens against all odds and deadlines are more of a suggestion than a rule. At DBU, we proudly guide students along the daang bakal—a challenging but unforgettable path filled with late nights, group chats, and academic survival skills. Whether you're here to learn, cram, or figure things out as you go, you are officially part of a university that proves success doesn't always take the easy road.</p>
    
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Daang Bakal University is committed to providing almost world-class education through time-tested shortcuts, creative cramming, and last-minute brilliance. We strive to shape resilient, resourceful, and slightly overconfident graduates who can survive deadlines, group works, and surprise quizzes. Guided by tradition, memes, and academic chaos, DBU prepares students to walk the “daang bakal” toward success—one requirement at a time.</p>
